# ChainLayerX

## 🧩 Project Description
**ChainLayerX** is a blockchain-based decentralized application that enables secure data registration, ownership verification, and timestamping. It allows users to register unique data hashes (like document fingerprints or digital assets) directly on-chain, ensuring authenticity and traceability.

## 🚀 Project Vision
The vision of **ChainLayerX** is to build a transparent and trustless layer of data verification for businesses and individuals, empowering them to secure and validate digital assets without intermediaries.

## 🌟 Key Features
- **Immutable Records:** Every data hash is permanently stored on-chain with a timestamp.
- **Ownership Verification:** Users can verify who owns a particular record.
- **Transparency:** Public access to data verification without exposing private information.
- **Decentralization:** Eliminates third-party dependencies for data validation.

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Integration with IPFS for decentralized file storage.
- Role-based access for enterprise-grade data control.
- Cross-chain interoperability for multi-network support.
- NFT-based proof-of-ownership certificates.
- API gateway for easy integration with existing systems.
